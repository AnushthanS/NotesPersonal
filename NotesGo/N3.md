# Implicit vs Explicit [[N2]] Variable Declaration 
- Implicit variable declaration is basically telling **Go** to take a guess as to what the type will be. It's mostly frictionless, but can sometimes produce errors in very large compilations.
***Undoubtedly the best way to declare variables due to the time saved.***

	eg -- `var number =100`
vs the explicit way `var number int64 = 100`

- We can ditch the var keyword using **:** 
operator called walrus operator.
`eg -- number:=300.99`
`fmt.Printf("%T",number) //Output = float64`

### Important declaration difference between this and Java
Once a variable is declared, it cannot be declared again, i.e its value can't be assigned again.
