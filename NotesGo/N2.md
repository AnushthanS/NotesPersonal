### To declare a variable --> 
`var <name of variable> <data type> = value`
### eg --> 
`var name string = Anushthan`

Variable is initialised, declared and assigned a value here. Of course all these steps can be done separately.

***
 **This is explicit variable declaration and assignment.
Not preferred, takes too much time. Instead, we use *implicit declaration* as discussed in [[NotesGo/N3]] .**

#data_type 
[Data Types](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-types-in-go/) aren't too different.
- Unsigned integers don't include negative values but the magnitude of data type remains same.
eg -- uint8 / byte **0 -- 255**
          int8  **-128 -- 127**
- We mostly use int64 or **machine dependent types** since modern computers have a large storage.
-> ***Machine Dependent Types*** : int or uint automatically get 32 or 64 bit depending on OS (32 or 64 bit).
Numbers, string and boolean are the primitive data types.
- rune<->int32, byte<->int8
