## About Arrays

- **delete** operator will remove an element from the array, but the length of the array won't change. It will only replace the specified index with a *empty item here* listing, will have the same size.
	- `[ 3, 4, <1 empty item> ]` will show this
	- **typeof** is another example of an operator
	- **delete** might work for other types of collections as well since it's an operator rather than a functionality of any particular data type.
- **push()** and **pop()** indicate that array in js might share some functionalities with stacks.
	- push returns the new length of the array, will of course modify it as well
		- *unshift()* will also return the new length of the array after adding a new element at the start
	- pop returns the popped element
		- *shift()* works as pop for the first element.

---- 

```ad-note
for the *sort()* function, the elements will be sorted based on the first letter.
```

 - expectedly, this means 200 comes before 3
	- therefore, we can pass something like a comparator function, which will return an integer value(again, really similar to a comparator) which will help to sort the collection.

```ad-example
let customComparator = (a, b) =>{
	return a - b;
}
```
