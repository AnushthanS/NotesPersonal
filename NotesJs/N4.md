- forEach is also a function/method of making array-based functions in js
- won't return a new array, it is simply there to iterate through a collection
	- have to use map for making a new array

```ad-tldr
arr.forEach( (element, index, array)=>{ funciton body });

```


```ad-example
arr.forEach((Element) => {
	console.log(Element \* Element);
});

```

----
- map function makes a new array by performing some operations on a given array
	- won't modify the original collection
- filter function returns a new array by filtering elements based on some condition
- reduce function reduces the array to a single value. It uses the result of each iteration as an input for the next iteration. For example, it will create a cumulative sum if `(a,b)=>{return a+b;}` is given as a reduce function

----
- Math class is pretty similar in javascript; random, floor, etc. work in a similar manner
- ## In browser js is limited in capabilites to protect user information and be more secure
