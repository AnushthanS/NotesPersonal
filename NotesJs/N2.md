### Object to Array
- Essentially converting a non-iterable collection to an iterable collection
- `Object.keys(obj)` will give all the keys of the object as an array
	- keys can be thought of as the variables defined within the object, their actual value isn't in the array
- `obj[key]` is used to referr to the value of any particular key
- `obj[Object.keys(obj)[index]]` is the way of iterating through an object without using the for-in loop

----

- Similar to other scripting languages, \` can be used to make sentences with literals inclued
- Can be referred to as *template literals*
```
let a = 10; let b = 20;
let string = `a = ${a} and b = ${b}`;
```

- This property of template literals, to be able to directly insert variables into a string is called **string interpolation**.
- **Many of the string functions are similar to Java string functions**.
- Just like Java, strings are **immutable** in js too
