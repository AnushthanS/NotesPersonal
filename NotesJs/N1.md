## Var vs Let vs Const
- `let` is defined for a code block, `var` is global-scoped.
- `let` can't be declared again, it can be reassigned in the block. `var` can be redclared anywhere in the entire code
- `const` can't be changed, is also block-scoped

----

- The Primitives in JavaScript are
	- null
	- undefined
	- boolean
	- number
	- String
	- BigInt
	- symbol
- An object in JavaScript is similar to a `struct` in C
- - `===` checks equality of both value and types, similarly there exists a `!==` 
- `prompt` will take a `string` input only
- switch works in a similar manner to Java
- `Number.parseInt()` can be used to get integer from a string, similar to Java in some ways
- the for-in loop works for objects (structs) whereas the for-of loop works for any iterable variable (eg: array)

----

- Arrow functions are the newer way to define functions in JavaScript, besides the **function** keyword:
 ```
 //arrow functions
const factorial = (n) =>{
if(n <= 1) return 1;
return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```
