- `console.time()` will start a timer for the code below it. Enclose some code between two `console.time("name")` to measure the time taken by the particular code block

 - **setTimeout()** will throw an error if a function is called as the first parameter. It only wants a callback function as a parameter, there isn't a need to call it. If a function is called then it's output will be treated as a parameter, which is often ignored or will throw an error if undefined.
