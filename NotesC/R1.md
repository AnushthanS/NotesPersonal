# Preprocessing to Execution
```
//File named main
 #include <stdio.h>
 int main(){
 	printf("Hello World\n");
	return 0;
 }
 //run with gcc -Wall -save-temps main.c -o hello
```
- preprocessing -> compilation -> assembly -> linking
- "#" describes a pre-processor statement. During preprocessing, comments are removed, any macros present are expanded and all mentioned header files are included in the code file itself.
- This preprocessed output is stored in a ".i" file. This will have all the header file code and the code programmer has written.
- During compilation, this ".i" preprocessed file is converted to assembly language instructions ".s" file.
- This ".s" file gets converted to a ".o" object file during assembly.
- The final linking process links all the required ".o" files to make an executable file.
