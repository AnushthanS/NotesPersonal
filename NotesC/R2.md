# Some String things
- Where Java uses `String.length()`, C uses  `strlen(String as character array)`.
- `gets(str as character array);` will also take a String input, but this method has been deprecated.
Also this method doesn't bother with the size of the array, can cause Buffer Overflow with unregulated inputs.

- `fgets(str, size, stdin);` will take a String input. It removes the chance of Buffer Overflow.
- `scanf("%[^\n]", str);` is the basic way of getting a String input, but make sure to add a space before the place holder if some non-character input has been taken prior in the program.

# Array randomness
- In C, array boundary is not checked.
```ad-example
int marks[4];
marks[8] = 90;
//will not give any error
```
