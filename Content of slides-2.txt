## 3. Don't be a football to other people's opinion:


Making choices is a part of everyday life. Various studies state that an average adult makes up to 35,000 decisions every day. We must have our own opinions while making these decisions, particularly if they impact our fate in the long run. The worst thing one can do is to be swayed by others' opinions at the moment of making an important decision and regretting the path that decision opened in front of them.


Slide 2:


While I do apply this to every decision, it particularly firmed my resolve when I had to choose a college. It is self-explanatory how big of a decision choosing one's college is. However, if I attended to the countless arguments thrown my way, I don't know if I would be this fulfilled, studying subjects that interest me, contrary to some stuff I wouldn't care about.




## 4.  Don't seek intentions behind other peoples mistakes: 


To make mistakes is a part of being human. No one willingly commits mistakes. There is no point in wasting time meticulously looking for the intention behind every mistake someone else makes. It won't fix that mistake. The time wasted could be directed towards something productive, like fixing the damage done.


Slide 2: 


Not seeking the intentions for someone's mistakes has largely benefitted my mental health. Instead of looking for any ill-will, I try to think of how to undo that mistake or look for potential fixes. This leads to an overall more productive experience.


## 5. Present moment is inevitable


Whether it's an occasion of celebration or a tragedy, we cannot change what has already occurred. That is the law of this universe. To accept the present for what it is is the best one can do. Even in the face of adversity, accepting the inevitability of the event and looking for the solution or a favorable outcome is infinitely better than worrying about it. 


Slide 2:


This knowledge has particularly benefited me in any test or exam. Sometimes we come across some questions related to unknown topics or some which are too tough for us. The worst thing to do is to ponder that the odds are stacked against you and that the rest of the exam will be terrible. Just accept that you don't know it and work on other problems while being optimistic about the outcome.


opposite values are complementary
LIGHT AND DARKNESS THESE TWO ARE OPPOSITE BUT THERE IS NO MEANING OF ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER.
IT’S THE DARKNESS WHICH GLORIFIES THE LIGHT


accept people and situation as they are
WE EXPECT OTHERS TO ACT LIKE US, BUT THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE.
EVERY PERSON IS DIFFERENT , WE NEED TO ACCEPT  THEM AS THEY ARE


don't be a football of other people's opinion
WE SHOULD NOT TAKE OUR DECISIONS ON THE BASIS OF PEOPLE’S OPINION, AS OPINIONS OF PEOPLE KEEP ON CHANGING .
WE SHOULD DO THINGS WHICH ARE GOOD FOR US.










Live in present. Present moment is inevitable:
 
Just as it’s   meaning suggests, the statement “Live in present. Present moment is inevitable” explains that the current point of time which is being spent by us this very moment is an inevitable one.
This very moment, be it blissful or agonizing is the result of all the actions which we have taken up until now.
 
This simple statement, when put right amount of thought into it will emerge into an exceptional philosophical lesson to all those who fear the present moment.
 
Of course, it is to be expected given the fact that the present moment won’t be the same for all. For some it may place them on the throne whereas for others it may push them into an abyss of despair. It may gift extraordinary luxuries for some while giving excruciating pain for others. However the one undeniable fact is no matter what the present moment throws at you we must never forget that it is inevitable. So everyone of us must learn to accept the moment as it is and should try our best to live the moment. Neither dwelling too much in the past by thinking “if I had done that” or “if I hadn’t done that” nor living in an imaginary utopian future  will do any good to us.
 
Application of the knowledge point in my life practically and the benefits I gained:
There were a lot of times where I foolishly questioned the present moment like “why did it turn out like this”. But a good thought into the situation led me think that it is inevitable. Having the moment we feared right before us and being unable to do anything to avoid it, is one of the most frustrating things for anyone. Even I felt that frustration many times and tried to run away from reality because there are always times where fate deals a hard blow on us which gives undesirable results even when we gave our best. But , “Present moment is inevitable. And I have to live in present.” this way of thinking, though I thought it in utter despair proved to be a ray of hope as it motivated me to start anew and plan future accordingly by taking a weight of fear and anxiety off my shoulders.
 
 
 
 
 
Accept people and situations as they are:
The second knowledge point “Accept people and situations as they are” tells us to accept the reality of the situation or about a person for what they are. In order to triumph our minds we need to to accept the situation for what it is not for what we want it to be.
 
Most of the people deny the situation they’re in ,they couldn’t believe  it and make futile attempts to alter it, which hurt them even further.
The same goes for people too. Everyone has their own unique set of qualities be it behavior, personality, adaptability etc. and everyone lives for their own sake. Denying people for whatever the reason will only hinder us. They are who they are not what we want them to be and whether we like it or not they will be themselves not others.
 
So we must learn to accept the people and the situations as they are so as to live peacefully.
 
Application of the knowledge point in practical life:
 
It took quite a lot of time to adjust to the practical application of the aforementioned knowledge point in my life. However, once I got used to it really helped me a lot.
There was a time when I was unable to accept certain situations that put me in a pinch. However delving too much into that situation by denying it used to make me frustrated and demotivated let alone changed the situation.
 
The same had happened with people too. I couldn’t accept some people whom I deemed unworthy of my acceptance which backfired and distanced me from social interactions at times. But when I realized the gravity of this knowledge point I couldn’t help but think how foolish I was to deny people judging from my perspective. It also made me learn that being picky about everything would only hinder us rather than helping us.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Opposite values are complementary:
 
The first knowledge point “opposite values are complementary” makes us realize that certain things which we deem to be opposing in nature might actually be complementary.
Their contrasting natures may give us an idea that they are completely opposing, but on giving a good thought into them we will be surprised to find that most of them are complementary.
 
For example, we generally think that light and darkness are opposite in nature but on a deeper look we find that it's due to the darkness that we are able to realize the value of light. At the same time the way we find one pleasing and other unpleasant also depends on the situation we’re in. When we  like to do work at night we would find a light pleasing but when we wrap up things and go to bed it’s that darkness which we find very pleasing as it helps us to relax.
 
Similarly what we find pleasing might not please others and vice versa.But we must remember that they’re just complementary and each has its own importance.
 
Application of the knowledge point in practical life:
 
Practical application of this knowledge point yielded very satisfactory results. I was able to learn to look from the other end of the arguments and it helped me a lot in maintaining my cool at the time of arguments and fostering good relations with others.






Present moment is inevitable.it’s only window for your life,because past is dead,future never comes.LIVE IN PRESENT.This is life.Every moment can bring magic,surprises when it comes.Look forward to it.


The present moment is  not linear ,it is spherical.It is vast and deep.There are infinite dimensions to the present moment.When you go deep in meditation,you experience this and realize that everything is in this moment only.The depth of silence ,the depth of visions,deams,etc… is all here and now –in the present moment.
*ACCEPT –THEN ACT 
Whatever present moment contains accept as  it is if you had chosen it.
Always work with it not against it.


 

##1 opposite values are complimentary

The world will be beautiful when people hav forgotten about beauty,because then there will be no ugliness.the world will be moral when people have completely forgotten the word”moral”,because then there will be no immorality.

Just imagine ,chose god and reject the devil;be good,don’t be bad.And more you try to be good the more you feel your badness inside.




Don’t compare positive and negative.How can love exist without hate?How can compassion exist without anger?How can life exist without death?How can happiness exist without unhappiness?How is heavenpossiblewithout hell?

Hell is not against heaven ,they are complementary,they exist together,in fact,they are two aspects of the same coin.Don’t compare.Enjoyboth.Let both of them exist.Create a harmony between the two.







## 4.  Don't see intentions behind other peoples mistakes: 

See when we commit amistakewe usually forgive ourselves and we think everybody do mistakes and ther is nothing to worrymuch about that.When it comes to others,we see intensions like they have done this intentionally.And then we start thinking about that for a long time and suffer ourselves.

If you see intention behind other people’s mistakes,and see that the intention was right but the action became wrong,you don’t mind that mistake so much and then the mind becomes free from anger,greed,jealousy and all these negative imperfections.

The present moment is inevitable. it’s the only window for your life because the past is dead, the future never comes. LIVE IN THE PRESENT. This is life. Every moment can bring magic, surprises when it comes. Look forward to it.


The present moment is not linear, it is spherical. It is vast and deep. There are infinite dimensions to the present moment. When you go deep in meditation, you experience this and realize that everything is in this moment only.
