Points of research
3. Don't be a football of other peoples' opinions
4. Don't see intentions behind other peoples' mistakes
5. Present moment is inevitable

Have to make a ppt
- 1st slide of ppt has to be an interesting introduction
- last slide has to be a conculsion with the name of the group members and their sections

For each point: 
- 2 slides
- 1st slide: heading of the point and your understanding of that knowledge point
- 2nd slide: how you applied that knowledge in practicality and benefitted in real life

&nbsp

This is how much text required to fill a slide completely. It is sort of difficult to fill an entire slide, and at the same time it seems like not much will be required to fill this up, kind of strange that the slide seems so big but the amount of text quickly becomes more and more. This isn’t a dilemma it is simply the fact that I haven’t ever made a slideshow, or at least haven’t in the past 6 years. It is pretty much a forgotten memory at this point.

&nbsp

(6-7 lines is standard, don't know how I can fill this up, will try to fill at least 4 lines).

## 3. Don't be a football to others' opinions:

Making choices is a part of everyday life. Various studies state that an average adult makes up to 35,000 decisions every day. We must have our own opinions while making these decisions, particularly if they impact our fate in the long run. The worst thing one can do is to be swayed by others' opinions at the moment of making an important decision and regretting the path that decision opened in front of them.

Slide 2:

While I do apply this to every decision, it particularly firmed my resolve when I had to choose a college. It is self-explanatory how big of a decision choosing one's college is. However, if I attended to the countless arguments thrown my way, I don't know if I would be this fulfilled, studying subjects that interest me, contrary to some stuff I wouldn't care about.


## 4.  Don't seek intentions behind others' mistakes: 

To make mistakes is a part of being human. No one willingly commits mistakes. There is no point in wasting time meticulously looking for the intention behind every mistake someone else makes. It won't fix that mistake. The time wasted could be directed towards something productive, like fixing the damage done.

Slide 2: 

Not seeking the intentions for someone's mistakes has largely benefitted my mental health. Instead of looking for any ill-will, I try to think of how to undo that mistake or look for potential fixes. This leads to an overall more productive experience.

## 5. Present is inevitible

Whether it's an occasion of celebration or a tragedy, we cannot change what has already occurred. That is the law of this universe. To accept the present for what it is is the best one can do. Even in the face of adversity, accepting the inevitability of the event and looking for the solution or a favorable outcome is infinitely better than worrying about it. 

Slide 2:

This knowledge has particularly benefitted me in any test or exam. Sometimes we come across some questions related to unknown topics or some which are too tough for us. The worst thing to do is to ponder that the odds are stacked against you and that the rest of the exam will be terrible. Just accept that you don't know it and work on other problems while being optimistic about the outcome.
