- On first glace, swift is extremely similar to C lang
- A blank project starts off with structs
- ```import SwiftUI ``` is the start of a Swift based app
- an app is defined as a struct
- app is a collection of scenes
- scenes are the way to display information graphically

<hr>

- # Content View
	- Has 2 structs by default, the main one being ContentView itself
	- Describes what to display and how
	- As for the second struct, at first glace it seems its intended to just start the execution of the first struct
