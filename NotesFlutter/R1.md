## Introduction
```
flutter create new-project
cd new-project
flutter run
```
- Run a default project for quick introduction to basic widgets
- Hot reload works just after a change is made.
- Material UI for basic applications
- Require a basic understanding of ***dart*** for this process


# Dart
- simple, scalable programming language
- compiles into **javascript**, making it very easy to deploy everywhere (optional)
- *const* must be constant at compile time, so it can't be assigned to a function call. *final*, however, can be assigned to such calls.
- *assert(condition)* is useful for debugging as the code will only execute if the condition is true
- `~/` is integer division, returns an integer answer only
