## Case Study

### About Q1
- Identified elements of successful teamwork.
- Should probably be included in Q3

### About Q2
- Would have listed everything necessary for effective teamwork

### About Q3
- We lead "high-potential" new hires for development of an international marketing campaign. We have to identify the steps one might take early on to ensure that the team is able to avoid Hackman's problems. We also have to identify what subtasks the goal can be split into for individual acocuntability.

#### Points: 
- Preferrably small teams to minimize types of co-ordination tasks that take up valuable time
- Know and understand the strengths and weaknesses of the group members.
- Know that later reconfigurations in team structure would lead to uncommunicated problems and challenges.
- Have to think about group based rewards, define individual responsibilities
- Leaders should be courageous and have consistent vision
- Some points about effectively breaking down the group's goal into smaller individual tasks to make everyone responsible for the project.


#### Answer 3

As a leader, we would first want to identify what our team's strengths and weaknesses are. For an international marketing campaingn, we'll identify what goals we want to accomplish, say the target demographic and the expected deadlines. Knowing every member's strengths would be absolutely crucial to divide this goal into a number of smaller tasks that we would be able to distribute to individual members, or to a sub-group within the team.

Earlier, we identified some of the problems Professor Hackman identified with respect to team work and working towards a smaller goal. He stated that teams size shouldn't be large, to co-ordinate subtasks better. He further stated that frequent changes in teams lead to poor performance as well as confusion with subtasks and time wastage. Changes in leadership team are never a good indicator of stability with respect to a task being done, or for an organization/ group's performance.  

To make sure we don't run into these problems, as a leader we should have a clear vision of our team's goals and responsibilites, and be ready to face any problem by directing team resources effectively. Effective practices need to be set up for easy co-ordination within members. We should define their responsibilities early on, which in turn means the leaders have to know what each member, or each sub-group has to accomplish to meet the goals. Any change in the structure further down will just lead to a huge waste of time and resources spent. It would also show a lack of vision and a lack of trust between the leader and the members.

With proper vision, a leader can break down the task to be accomplished into a number of smaller subtasks. We then identify whether these tasks are something an individual can accomplish or whether a smaller group is required to finish it. As the leader, it will also be our responsibility to keep the communication between these subgroups/ individuals as frictionless as we can. Lastly, we need to merge the results obtained and evaluate what remains and what is accomplished effectively.
