#Thursday 
Following Tuesday's timetable for the most part

### 11 AM - #DLD 
- Ring counter using D flip flop
- Johnson counter using D flip flop

### 12 PM - #DSMA 
- Partial ordering continued
- Two elements are comparable if they satisfy the partial ordering relation
- It is a partial ordering since not all elements are comparable
- For a total ordering, all elements have to be comparable(also called a chain) (Eg- less than equal to relation is totally ordered)
- (S, ordering) is a well-ordered set if it is a poset such that the ordering is total ordering and every non empty subset of S has a least element
- Hasse diagram for partial orders

### 2 PM - #OCW lab
- Problems on IP addressing
- Each octet has 8 bits
- TCP/IP
- Internet protocols(HTTP, HTTPS, etc.)
- IP address
	- Network, Host, Subnetwork and Subnet Mask
	- Subnet Mask is essential to an IP address, the two together get a network id
	- IP addressing done in accordance to some classes: 
		- Class A: First octet(3 digits) for network id, other three groups for host id (from 0 to 127: 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255)
		- Class B: First 2 octets for network, other two groups for host(from 128 to 191: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255)
		- Class C: First 3 octets for network, last for host(192 to 223: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255)
- static and dynamic ip
- lan networks
- NS2 (network simulator) demo
- http and https
