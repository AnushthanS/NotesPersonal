## Point methodology: 
1. Perception: Computer is essentially a device created to solve problems.
2. Observation: Computers solve problems faster and in a more efficient manner than us.
3. Inference: Information in electrical form manipulated by doing billions of computations per second using multiple processors similar to our brain.
4. Newness: While we were bound to the language of computers for designing our programs, the future lies in the currently developing Artificial Intelligence, capable of understanding our language and hopefully our emotions in the near future.
5. Traditions: Using Abacus to calculate faster and in a more efficient manner  can be dated back to as early as 2400 BC. The ancient greek have been credited to making the oldest analogue computer to predict astronomical positions and eclipses decades in advance.


## Barriers to learning: 
1. Losing track of time while on breaks :: Setting timers for breaks
2. Getting distracted by unusual noises/ disturbance :: Study with some controlled background music
3. Putting things off till the last day :: Starting the task as soon as its recieved
4. Lack of energy :: Exercising everyday/ going for a walk in the evening
5. Being forgetful or careless about important events to eventually giving up on them :: Writing them down in a journal maintained frequently
