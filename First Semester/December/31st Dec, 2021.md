### 11 AM - #DSMA 
- Rules of inference, using premise and conclusion.
- Axioms or assumptions used to deduce theorems using rules of inference(infer = to conclude).
- Derivation of a theorem is called proof.
- Constructive and Destructive Dilemma (not explicitly mentioned in book).
- Rules for inference for Quantified statements.

### 12 PM -  #CP 
- Operators: Relational, Logical, Assignment, Increment/Decrement, Conditional(?), Bitwise, Special
- Note that C programming treats Boolean as 1 or 0 bit, so we use %d placeholder, 1 for true.
- Already studied the conditional operator : `c = (a<b)? a:b;`, sometimes called ternary operator 'cause usually 3 operators are involved.
- Special :- comma[,] (combine related expressions)(familiar with this `int a=5,b=6;`), sizeof().
