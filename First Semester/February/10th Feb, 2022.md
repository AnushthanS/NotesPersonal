#Thursday 
### 9 AM - #CCI 
- aerosol dry removal: gravity/ obstructions/ coagulations
- precipitation scavenging(removal by precipitation)
- Milankovich cycle, solar flux spots and volcanic activities included in natural climatic change reasons
- Evidences: heat wave/ shifting of onset of rainfall/ drought during summer
- rainfall unpredictable, have to take from groundwater table, but it has to be recharged
- The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) 

### 10 AM - #CP 
- Recursion

### 11 AM - #OCW 
- Fundamental differences between 4g and 5g
- Wireless LAN
- History/evolution of communication devices

### 12 PM - #DLD 
- BCD to Gray code converter
- BCD to 7-segment decoder
- Decoder

### 3 PM - #OCW lab
- fundamentals of matlab
- vector is a one dimensional array
- `x= 0:5` gives `0 1 2 3 4 5`, `x=0:0.5:4` will give `0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4` 
- basically `start: inc/dec value: end` like python
- `format short` and `format long` to switch precision
- `x = y'` will give the matrix transpose
- The way we solve linear equations is called *symbolic computation*. 
- Linear algebra method used in matlab to compute equations 
- Assigment: 1- to generate a periodic function
x(t) = rect(t)
rect(t) = A when 0<= t<= T
0 elsewhere


- sine plots with:
	- different amp
	- different freq(Omega)
	- different phase difference

`subplots(a,b,c) `basically creates a matrix of figures. First 2 digits depict the size of matrix, third is the position of plot in created matrix
