### 10 AM - #OCW 
- Starting module 4: Mobile device communication
- A basic understanding of different communication methods we use in our mobiles and computers
- Inverse square law: Power inversely to dist^2

### 11 AM - #CP 
- Macros are basically single line functions defined easily using `#define`
Eg- `#define areaTriangle(base, height) (0.5 * base * height)`
- `x + rand() % y` will return a random value between x and y
- Scope of variable in c is weird, basically one variable can be declared multiple times for different code block . Makes everything super weird.
- Pointer completed within 2 minutes
