#Wednesday 
### 9 AM - #OCW 
- Start of Module 3
- Started with Operating System, focus on Kernel
- Transitioned into Linux

### 10 AM - #DLD 
- Using universal gates (NAND and NOR) to make other gates.
- Circuit design for functions using some specified gates.

### 11 AM - #DSMA 
- Inverse functions and composition of functions
- (f o f^(-1)) (x) = x
- pg 148-151
- Sequences and Summations
- A sequence is a function from a set of non-negative integers(from natural or whole numbers or their subset) to some set S.
- We mostly use Natural numbers for a real-life sequence. Eg - *arithmetic progression, geometric progression*

### 2 PM - #DLD lab
- Decoders
- Combinational and sequential circuits
- 3:8 Decoder
- 2:4 decoder with enable
- Make 3:8 decoder and 4:16 decoder
- 4:16 decoder with 3:8
