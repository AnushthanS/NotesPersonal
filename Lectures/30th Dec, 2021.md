#Thursday 
### 10 AM - #CP 
- use sizeOf() to check for memory size of any data type.
- Variable sizes mostly similar to Java.
- int is 4 bytes, long int is 4 bytes and long long int is 8 bytes.
- double is 8 bytes, long double is 10 bytes.
- float - 6precision, double -15
- Eg- `int a;`
`printf("%zu",sizeof(a)); // %zu or %lu place holders for size`
- Format specifier for double = `%lf`, for long double = `%LF`
- `10U` for defining 10 as an unsigned value.
- `long long int = 100LL; //LLU for unsigned`
- `100L for long int, LU for unsigned` 
- `gcc -w sample.c` will not display any warnings, only errors.
- can use`314e-3` while declaring double or long double.
- Use `10.0L` for long double.
- width of precision in format specifiers.

### 11 AM - #OCW 
- History of OS.
- Batch -> Multiprogramming -> Time-Sharing/Multitasking -> Multiprocessing(we have multiple cores now) -> Distributed -> Network -> Real-Time -> Embedded
- Moved on to File System.
- Modern Operating Systems from Tanenbaum.

### 2 PM - #OCW lab
- Continuation of File System.
- Sequential access and Random access.
- Sequential - Read from the beginning, you can't skip.
- Random - Start wherever you want to.
- Continuous allocation(Sequential).
- Linked List allocation using a file allocation table(Sort of sequential, sort of random).
