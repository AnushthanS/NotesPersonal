### 8:45 AM - #FHVE 
- Sudarshan Kriya

### 10 AM - #OCW 
- Introduction to database
- Drawbacks to using file system for data management

### 11 AM - #CP 
- There is no String data type, we use a character array, but we don't declare it like we do in java. Also, the place holder for this character arrray will still be %s. Using %c will give the first character only.
- Eg -> `char name[20] = "Anushthan";`
`char input[100];` there is no new keyword here.
- No need to use & for char or string  while using scanf.
- Space will break the input. Use the following regex-like function to ignore the space as required.
Eg -> `scanf("%[^\n]", name);`
- User defined data types: ***typedef, enum, struct, union***.
- typedef is essentially data type rename
- Print formatting
- Pre-processor directive, not similar to java, there can't be a local declaration of this variable any more.

### 2 PM - #CP lab
- , in C is really different from Java.
- eg -> `a = 3,4;` will set a = 3 with no errors.
- eg -> `a = (3,4);` will set a = 4
