- MaxEnt plots into QGIS.
- Major classification of crops and cropping seasons in India
- How climate influences agricultural production:
	- Crop water requirement/Irrigation requirement: Some areas are rainfall dependent(rainfed agriculture)/ water has to be provided artificially otherwisen to meet the requirement.
	- Geographical shift of species/Climate suitability of agricultural crops: 
	- Crop yield

- Time elapsed from planting to maturity is crop period

### 10 AM - #CP 
- Double pointers
- nested structures
- Union: strange use cases for this since this looks like a structure but we have to assign values to objects and use them as it will only store the last value.

### 11 AM - #OCW 
- Ethernet- different generations, components, addressing, frame
- A 48bit address is assigned when an NIC card is manufactured
- packets sent to- 
	- single address: unicast
	- all addresses: broadcast
	- a subset of stations: multicast

- Loss and delay of packets and how to counter them
- Four sources of packet delay-- Transmission delay, Queueing delay, Propagation delay, Processing(nodal) delay
- Traffic intensity

### 12 PM - #DLD 
- State equations and tables

### 2 PM - #OCW lab
- Configuring a router
- PingPlotter
- WireShark
