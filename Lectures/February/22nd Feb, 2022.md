### 12 PM - #DSMA 
- For sets A and B, A xor B = AUB - A^B
- Composite of Relation R and S is defined as S o R (take ordered pairs by taking elements of R and S where second element of ordered pair from R is equal to some first element of an ordered pair from S)
	- eg- (2,3) in R and (3,1) is S gives (2,1) is S o R
	- This gives power of relations when S = R 

- Matrix representation of a relation

### 3 PM - #DSMA
