- Equivalence class of an element a of some equivalence relation R is the set of all elements related to a.
- Equivalence classes of two elements of some set A are either equivalent or disjoint, unless the two elements are related.
- Union of all equivalence classes gives the original set of R.
- Partial orderings are relations which are relfexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
- R is a partial order defined on S. The set S together with R is called a poset, denoted by (S, R). Elements of S here are called elements of the poset.
	- \>= relation on set of integers is a partial ordering.
	- (Z, >=) is a poset
