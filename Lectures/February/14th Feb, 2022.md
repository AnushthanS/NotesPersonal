#Monday 
### 10 AM - #OCW 
- Mobile Networks Evolution in a more technical sense.
- Multi-hopping is essentially extending range of towers using smaller relays
- Signal quality is really good for higher frequencies

### 11 AM - #CP 
- Tail recursion
- `srand(time(NULL));` this is the random seed generator, it specifies a starting point for random number sequence.
- `time(NULL)` from `time.h` will link the seed generator with computer clock for a variety of random numbers.
- `rand()` is actually not that random and there are multiple duplicates.

### 2 PM - #CP lab
