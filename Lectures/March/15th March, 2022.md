- In a vector space, we can add any two matrices or multiply a constant to that matrx, the result will stay in the same space
- Subspace is the SET of VECTORS INCLUDING 0 which satisfies two requirements. Say v and w are two vectors and c is a scalar:	
	- v+w will be in the subspace
	- cw or cv will be in the subspace

- Essentially space is similar to set, subspace is similar to subset
