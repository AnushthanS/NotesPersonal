#Tuesday 
### 9 AM - #FHVE 
- Surya Namaskar
- Accept people and situations as they are(active acceptance)

### 11 AM - #DLD 
- Complement input is not considered part of any level in some implementation.
- Integrated Circuits basics

### 12 PM - #DSMA 
- Went back to logic
- Normal forms: Disjunctive Normal Form(DNF) and Conjunctive Normal Form(CNF)
- Elementary product: A product of the variables and their negations in some logical function is called an elementary product.
	- Eg: p^q^~r
	- It is identically false(fallacy) if the formula contains at least one pair of factors such that one is complement of another

- Elementary sum: A sum of the variables and their negations in some logical function is called an elementary sum.
	- Eg: pv~qvr
	- It is identically true(tautology) if the formula contains at least one pair of factors such that one is complement of another

- DNF(Disjunctive normal form): A formula which is equivalent to a given formula and which consists of sum of elementary products(SOP). 
- p <-> q is (p^q) v (~p^~q), that is, either both are true or both are false.

- CNF(Conjunctive normal form) : A formula which is equivalent to a given formula and which consists of product of elementary sum(POS). 
- Prove that there are an infinite number of primes

### 3 PM - #DSMA 
- Mistakes in proof
- Summation
- Cardinality of sets
- Countability, Aleph null being the smallest infinity which is countable
	- pg 173
- A set is countable if it shows one to one correspondence to the set of integers
