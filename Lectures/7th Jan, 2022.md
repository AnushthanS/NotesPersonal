#Friday 

### 9 AM - #CCI
- Missed class, sudden mail 10 minutes before class

### 11 AM - #DSMA 
- Start of unit 2(set theory)
- Some common sets: Natural, Rational, Integer
- Interval of numbers (open and closed interval brackets)
- Null, singleton, universal, subsets, equal sets
- Cardinality of sets, Power set *P*(S)
- Power set also denoted sometimes as 2[^s].
- Ordered n-tuple : {a1, a2, a3, ..., an} , an ordered collection for which the order matters.
- Ordered 2-tuples are called ordered pairs, and we know why the order is important there.
- Cartesian product

### 12 PM - #CP 
- Since boolean in C is 0 or 1, if(flag) is equivalent to if(flag !=0)
- if (flag) ; will give an error in Java but not in C. Control will check for condition, may execute nothing or may execute else part.
