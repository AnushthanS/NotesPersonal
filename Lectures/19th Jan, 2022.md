#Wednesday 
### 10 AM - #DLD 
- Fan-in and Fan-out circuits: exactly what they sound like.
- Fan-in is basically the number of inputs to a gate
- Fan-out is basically the number of gate inputs that can be driven by the output of another single logic gate of same family.
- Noise-margin: The unwanted signal (referred to noise) can induce undesirable voltage on the connecting wire between logic circuits. The maximum noise voltage added to an input signal of a digital circuit that does not cause an undesirable change in the circuitâ€™s output is noise margin

### 11 AM - #DSMA 
- If A and B are countable, A U B is countable
- If |A| <= |B| and |B| <= |A| then |A| = |B|, i.e., A has one to one correspondence to B
- Recurrence relations, closed form of a function, forward substitution

### 12 PM - #OCW 
- Rescheduled from 9AM
- Shell scripting
- \`\` to store some output 
- if elif else fi
- for loops: for do done

### 2 PM - #DLD lab
- Priority encoders and MUX
- 4to2, 8to3, 16to4 Encoder
- 4to2 Priority Encoder
- 4:1, 8:1, 16:1 MUX
