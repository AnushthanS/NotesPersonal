#Friday 
### 11 AM - #DSMA 
- Proposition is a declarative sentence, will be either true or false.
- Area of logic dealing with propositions is called propositional calculus/logic.
- p,q,r,s -> propositional variables.
- not p -> it is not the case that p is true
- Ferma's last theorem //something we'll study later.
- Inclusive OR is disjunction (v), means it can be true even if both p and q are true, but exclusive OR is equivalent of *Either this or that*.
- p -> q == If p then q ; p:hypothesis(antecedent or premise), q:conclusion(consequence).  This is an example of a compound proposition.  False when p is true and q is false.

### 12 PM - #CP
- Some linux commands and the hello world c program.
