### 9 AM - OCW
- Number system.
- System bus in computer architecture.
- At the bottom of the motherboard, there are visible electronic pathways(communication pathways). These form the bus, connects devices.
- It is a shared communication system.
- Two devices cannot transmit signals through a bus at the same time due to signal collisions.
- Control Unit of CPU helps in this situation.
- A bus consists of multiple communication pathways, each line capable of transmitting signals: binary 0 and binary 1. These can carry binary digits simultaneously(in parallel).
- *A bus which connects major computer components(processor, memory, I/O) is called a system bus.*
- Has 50-100 lines.
- System bus architecture: has 3 buses- address,  data and control bus.

### 10 AM - DLD
- Borrow and Difference for substracting a bigger number from a smaller one.
- 1's and 2's complement for subtraction.

### 11 AM - DSMA
- Pretty much a continuation of previous lecture[[21st Dec, 2021]].
- De Morgan's laws for logical equivalence.
- Other laws of such nature.

### 2 PM - DLD Lab
