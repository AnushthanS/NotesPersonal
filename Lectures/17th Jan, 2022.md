#Monday 
### 9 AM - #OCW 
- Inode and the information stored in it
- File access rights, (rwx)(rwx)(rwx)
- first 3 rwx belong to owner, second 3 belong to the group, last group depicts other
- Eg - add all required users to a group and give that group the required access rights so that no other person can modify the file.
- first place of this combination will be either d or -, d means a directory and - means a file
- Extremely basic usage of *chmod* (change mode)
- sometimes, 4 is for read, 2 is for write and 1 is for execute
- chmod flags can be substituted with octal values for changing permissions quickly without using multiple flags
- Using octal values is absolute mode, flags signify symbolic mode

### 11 AM - #CP
