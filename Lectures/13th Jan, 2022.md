#Thursday 
### 9 AM - #CCI 
- Earth's components; Started with Oceans(finished atmosphere)
- 70% surface area covered with water
- Mass of atmosphere = 5.1 x 10 ^18 kg
- Mass of all ocean water == 250 times that of atmosphere
- Top - mixed layer, water mixes due to wind
- Mid layer - Pycnocline
- Bottom - Thermocline or deep layer
- Density of sea water - 1.02-1.03 kg/m^3 (can take 1)
- Ocean circulation in polar region: The mixed layer becomes considerably dense due to low temperature
- Thermohaline circulation due to water density(really slow)
- Surface layer circulation due to wind(faster)
- Starting cryosphere
- Water in form of ice is considered in cryosphere

### 10 AM - #CP 
- Loops; while, for, do while
- while and for- pretest loops(tests condition first), do while post test
- Similar to every other boolean it just checks for non-zero value to work
- Non-zero for boolean true
- `while ((ch = getchar()) != '\n') ` also works in C
- `for( ; ; )` works as an infinite loop here, not sure if this works in Java, will have to test

### 12 PM - #DLD 
- Designing digital circuits using NAND and NOR
- n-level implementation: an input takes at most n gates to convert to a required output. 
- **One level has one type of gates**

### 2 PM - #OCW lab
-
