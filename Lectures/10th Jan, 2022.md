#Monday 
### 10 AM - #OCW 
- Revised Programming tools for a Database quiz.

### 11 AM - #CP 
- Starting with switch
- `include<string.h>` to use `getchar()` for taking a character input.
- 
```
int j=0;
if(j = 1){}
else {}
```
will go to if, c language doesn't compulsarily require a boolean expression, it will check for the final value, whether it is 0 or not, since boolean here is 0 or 1.

- `switch(num1 > num2)` will actually work since boolean evaluates to 0 or 1. 

### 2 PM - #CP lab
- 5 programs dealing with flow control
- `int flag = strcmp(string1, string2); //will give 0 when strings are equal`
