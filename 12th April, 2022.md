#Tuesday 

### 10 AM - #SS
- Studying for signal processing
- We study a system under abstraction as a mathematical model
- Mathematical oriented course on how we express signals and how we mathematically model a system
- A signal x(t) is a set of data or function of time which represents a variale of interest
- Contains information about the nature of a phenomenon.
	- Eg- Temperature, humidity, human voice, television images, etc.

- A system transforms one signal to another. 
	- Eg- Electric guitar, electric circuits, computer programs, weather, stock market, human body, etc.

- A system is a collection of devices that operate on some input signal to produce an output signal
- A mathematical model of a physical process that relates the input signal to an output signal
- Applications: Difficult to store analog data
	- Wireless communication: 4g and beyond
	- Surveillance: radars and satellites
	- advanced driver assistance systems

### 11 AM - #CA
- Look up *volatile* keyword
- We'll have to study assembly
- Most languages are compiled to assembly as a necessary intermediate
- Good for limited memory
- Look up volatile keyword 
- Compilation and linking process

### 12 PM - #PS
- Statistical analysis of data for any machine learning framework
- While making models, we might come across a large number of uncertainities. We can replace those variables with simple probability functions to get a near accurate answer
- Reliability and life time of a software product
- Sample space is set of all possible outcomes
- Eg: Driving, waiting times for let's say a bus, life time of a software product(generally a year), coin toss experiments, casino games, etc.
- Keypoint: Uncertainity in outcomes.
- Lifetime of a transistor(eg: in hours) is an example of continuous sample space
- Event is a set of outcomes, always a subset of sample space
- Union, intersection, complement, mutually exclusive, subset of event, superset of event
- Commutative, associative and distributive laws

### 2 PM - #SS lab
- Matlab introduction
- plot
t goes from 0 to 10
0-2 0
2-4 t
4-10 onwards t\*sin(5\*t) 

- plot 2
t goes from 0 to 100
from 0-10  t
from 10-20 log(t)
from 20-100 t e^(-2t)
