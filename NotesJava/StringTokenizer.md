### package --> java.util.StringTokenizer
- Refer this [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stringtokenizer-class-java-example-set-1-constructors/) article for examples, also the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/java/util/StringTokenizer.html) is really helpful.
- Default constructor breaks a String into tokens with the default delimiters, usually space or newline.
- Second constructor (String, delimiter) makes a custom delimiter to break String with. There is also a flag here(false by default).
- Third constructor (String, delimiter, boolean flag) will give the delimiter as a token if the flag supplied is true.
- Delimiter String checks individual characters to break the string with.
