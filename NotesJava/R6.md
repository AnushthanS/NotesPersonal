## Typecast when in doubt
1. To change int to corresponding char by ascii values, use typecast ->
`int i= 65;`
`char c = (char)i;   --> output = A`
Same method to convert char to int.

2. Also there is no scan.nextChar() method for scanner, use String reader and take the first character from it.
3. *Character cannot be typecast to String, we have to use concat for that.*
****
## Random *ArrayList, LinkedList, ArrayDeque*
-  Most of the methods here return Object data type so we have to use `(List<E>)` typecast or `ArrayList<E>` typecast ->

`List<Integer> lt = (List<Integer>) AnyList.clone();`

`ArrayList<Integer> literalClone = new ArrayList<>();`
`literalClone = (ArrayList<Integer>) AnyArrayList.clone();`

- **add** and **addAll** features add the value(s) to the end fo the list by defaullt, but an index input can be given for desired output.
- [Oracle Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/index.html) are helpful, as usual.

&nbsp
- **LinkedList** commands are extremely similar. They have some differences, of course, since ***LinkedList implements Deque, unlike ArrayList which implements AbstractList.*** eg- `addLast`and`addFirst`methods.

&nbsp
- **ArrayDeque** * implements Deque interface*, like LinkedList and so has similar methods.

#### **Like Arrays.sort for arrays, use Collections.sort**
