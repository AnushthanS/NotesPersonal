# Currency Formatting Problem
#format 
`NumberFormat <name> = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(Locale custom/predefined);`
Then use `<name>.format(anyDouble);` to get the desired value.

Eg ->
- Custom Locale for India -

`Locale indLocale = new Locale("en","IN");`
`NumberFormat india = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(indLocale);`
`System.out.println("India : "+india.format(double payment));`

The first tag "en" is for language, second tag "IN" for country.
Have to look these up for building a custom locale.

- Predefined locale -
`NumberFormat us = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(Locale.US);`
`System.out.println("US : "+us.format(double payment));`

# Hash
- Hashing is to *convert key-value pair to an index* using a simple *modulus* function of array size.
- **Eg **- for an aray of size 10,   11%10=1 so 11 would be stored at index 1.
 - Obviously this will lead to collisions. Continuing the example above, 21%10 is also 1.

 #### There are multiple ways to deal with hash collisions : 
 1. *Open Addressing :* Store the colliding values in the next open slot adn shift the following elements one index up.
 2. *LinkedHashSet : * Make a linked list at the collision point to store all the values of the same index.
