# Sorting stuff I found while solving Anagram Problem

*import java.util.Arrays;* for all the methods discussed.

- To convert a String **a** to a character array **aa**, use `char aa[] = a.toLowerCase().toCharArray();`
- To #sort an array, use `Arrays.sort(aa);`
- To check for equality after sorting -> `Arrays.equals(aa,bb);` This returns a boolean value.
****
# Break in nested loops
Use tags. eg -->
`outer : for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)`
`{ inner : for(int j=0;i<=i;j++)`
`{ if(cond) break outer;}}`

*Arrays in Java aren't continuously allocated like C or Cpp*

```


- Since there are no pointers in Java, it entirely depends on the *JVM* as to whether it continuously allocates array memory or not.
- We assume it to be continuous for ease of use, and for the fact that most of it is continuous.
- This is mainly due to the array object being dynamically initialized only, and directly in the heap. **Heap objects are almost never continuous.**
