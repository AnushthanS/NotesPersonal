# Static keyword
- Static is a *non-access modifier*.
- Static methods are only executed once, before the class object is invoked.
- They are executed even before the constructor. Also a class' object is not required to call a static variable or static method from it.
- We use static methods or variable when they have to remain unchanged for a good chunk of code, like setting college name for a group of students.

# Integer(or any other type) to String methods
#type_conversion  #data_type 
1. Concat method -
`int i=10;`
`String s= ""+i;` 

2. `String.valueOf(int i)` gives *i*  in String format, can be concatenated now.
`Integer.toString(i)` works similarly.
**Similar for other data types!**

3. #format method --> `String.format`
`int i=10; String ans = new String.format("%d",i);`
