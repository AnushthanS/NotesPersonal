## Everything is an object
- print works just like Java or C, format: `print("Hello")` or `print "Hello"`
- `print self  OR  print(self)` will return main, the primary object of the code
- `print "Hello World!"` is the simple print function, no termination required for the sentence
- ```;``` isn't required for sentence termination, also provides memory protection
- **Purely object oriented** programming language just like Java
