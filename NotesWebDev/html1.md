# Intro to HTML
- Each HTML file starts and ends between a `<html>` (**open** tag) and `</html>` (**close** tag).
- **Metadata** about the web page is located in the `<head>` `</head>` tags
- **Everything seen** in the browser is between the `<body>` `</body>` tags
- Just to follow the standard, start the file with a single tag `<!Doctype html>`
- A [[Tags]] file, an [[Attributes]] file  and an [[Entities]] file is being maintained to keep track of every tag ever encountered while learning or using HTML for the first 2 months.
- Tags used within the paragraph tags which **don't create a new line** are called **in-line tags**. <u>Eg-</u> `<em>`, `<strong>`, etc.
- Tags like the paragraph `<p>` or the headers  like `<h2>`  are block level tags since they add a new line in the flow of statements.
- **html entities** start with an ampersand *&* and are special html properties similar to escape sequences in some other languages.
