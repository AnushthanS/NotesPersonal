# Intro to HTML
- Each HTML file starts and ends between a `<html>` (**open** tag) and `</html>` (**close** tag).
- **Metadata** about the web page is located in the `<head>` `</head>` tags
- **Everything seen** in the browser is between the `<body>` `</body>` tags
- Just to follow the standard, start the file with a single tag `<!Doctype html>`
- A [[Tags]] file and an [[Attributes]] file is being maintained to keep track of every tag ever encountered while learning or using HTML for the first 2 months.
