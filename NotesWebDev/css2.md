# Flex

- ## Flex as well as flex properties are applied on the parent container
- When the page size changes, the flex container shrinks all the content equally even if the width provided for the content isn't in percentages.
- Content is justified in a line, while alignment works top to bottom for the whole container.
- ### IMP: Flex-grow  can make boxes of proportional sizes to better  fit in the flex even if they have a fixed width and height.
