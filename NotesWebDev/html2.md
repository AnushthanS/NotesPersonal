- **paragraph elements** `<p>` make extra space in formatting, looks like an extra line when other things appear around them
- Keep validating html codes from the [**w3c markup validator**](https://validator.w3.org)
- Any picture below the fold should have the lazy value set for the loading attribute, default is eager.
- Semantic tags can often be changed by `<div>` tags but they decrease the code readability greatly, for which the use of semantic tags is appreciated.
