### Structure

Your use of bullet points is good! Resumes should predominantly be written using bullet points (and not paragraphs). Bullet points break up text and make it easy for recruiters to get a sense of your achievements.

Before I move on to the next section, I wanted to add a final note on your template. While your template highlights your work experience, it can likely be better optimized to get past applicant tracking systems (ATS). If you're not familiar with ATS, they are software that employers use to auto-reject resumes that aren't a fit - they are a somewhat recent addition to the hiring process, but they're incredibly popular and 95%+ of Fortune 500 employers use them to screen out resumes.

If your resume isn't able to be properly read by these systems, you won't be able to get past the auto-screening stage. Avoid using resume builder websites to create your resume as they may be unreadable by these systems, and can come across as amateur-ish.

As part of all our resume writing packages, we'll set you up with a professionally designed resume that is readable by all Applicant Tracking Systems, highlights your core achievements, and most importantly, is familiar to hiring managers so you make a professional first impression.


#### Recommendations & Next Steps

Your resume is missing key outcomes throughout the document.

While a reader wants to understand what you did, they really want to know what it resulted in and/or the greater impact on your employer.

Your resume needs visual improvement.

Spacing, margins, sections, and color must be professionally used to make the resume appear full yet uncluttered, well-organized but not boring, and eye-catching without being too flashy.

Your resume is missing many keywords and skills.

Adding words and skills specific to your intended field and position will help you stand out as capable and qualified.

### Impact and Experience

Recruiters and hiring managers look for one thing on your resume: impact. There are a lot of ways you can emphasize impact - ranging from using stronger language to including bullet points that highlight your strongest achievements. Let's go through a couple of ways I noticed you can improve your resume's impact.

Some of your resume's bullet points come across as weak - they don't show how you made an impact and should be improved. Let's look at an example from your resume:

Contributed as a member of the client-side division within the Abhisarga (college festival) tech team, focusing on frontend development with NextJS and animations using GSAP/Framer Motion.

This is an example of a line that is more of a responsibility, than an actual accomplishment. One way to make this more accomplishment-oriented is by using stronger language and highlighting your specific impact on the company. Did your work increase revenue, increase efficiency, save costs or drive sales? By how much? Using actual numbers or dollar amounts are good ways to showcase your impact.  
  
Ultimately, employers want to know what you can _do_ for them - and examples of what you've accomplished before help them see that.

### Language

I noticed you used weak language like **contributed**, **utilized** and **member of**. Words and phrases like these are overused, too generic and often reduce the impact of your achievements. Instead, you should instead use stronger, unique action verbs (e.g. Managed, Developed or Implemented) that make your accomplishments stand out.

**contributed**, **utilized** and **member of**

Some of your bullet points could also use some trimming down, so they're 'punchier' and more effective. For example, I saw filler words like, **extensive, various and effectively** . I call these filler words because they take up space, without adding anything substantial to your accomplishments. Remember - one of the key elements of a top resume is conciseness. You need to keep your bullets succinct so recruiters can get to the heart of your accomplishments. Most people benefit from a deeper word-for-word review of their resume - it's easy to miss tiny errors on a resume, especially if you've spent a lot of time working on your resume.

### ATS Scan

Earlier in my review, I introduced you to Applicant Tracking Systems, or ATS. Before I wrap up, I want to tell you a little more about them, in the context of your resume.

Employers use resume screening software, called Applicant Tracking Systems, to auto-reject resumes that don't seem to have the experience or skills the job requires. Employers use these tools to save time - they don't want to manually go through every resume, so they use tools to filter out resumes that don't have specific words on them. For example, if you were applying for a supply chain role, but the phrase 'supply chain' wasn't on your resume, your resume would probably not progress to the next stage (where a recruiter manually reviews it). Most resumes don't even reach a recruiter.

To get past the resume screeners, you should tailor your resume to each job you apply to. With my clients, I spend time to understand the kinds of roles they want, and identify the keywords and hard skills that are important for them to include.

#### Skills

Your resume has been analyzed by our ATS, and here are the skills it identified as your strengths. While this list includes a mix of hard and soft skills, along with other keywords, it offers valuable insight into how an ATS interprets your resume:
