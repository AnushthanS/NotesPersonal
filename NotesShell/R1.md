## The extremely basic stuff

1. `cat /etc/shells` will give all the supported shells.
2. `-rwx-rwx-rwx or drwx-rwx-rwx` file access rights are listed in this particular manner, starting from owner on the left to then the group allocated and then finally everyone else. d is for directory, a file otherwise.
3. `chmod` is used to change the file access rights, with either `chmod u+rwx` or `chmod ag+rwx` or `chmod 764` types, of course with a variety of flags.
4. Any script starts with a *shebang*, or at least it should. It makes it easier to read it and the terminal can even call the shell if it isn't the one executing the script.
5.
 ```ad-example
 title: Hello World Script
 #! /opt/homebrew/bin/fish
 echo Hello World! 
 \# are typically comments
```

## Single vs Double quotes
``` ad-note
title: *Difference between single and double quotes*
- Single quotes don't support arguments, simply print everything.
- Double quotes support actual arguments(can be thought of as support for place holders).
```
```ad-example
name = Anushthan
echo "Name = $name" \#gives Name = Anushthan
echo 'Name = $name' \#actually prints Name = $name
```
