This is how much text required to fill a slide completely. It is sort of difficult to fill an entire slide, and at the same time it seems like not much will be required to fill this up, kind of strange that the slide seems so big but the amount of text quickly becomes more and more. This isn’t a dilemma it is simply the fact that I haven’t ever made a slideshow, or at least haven’t in the past 6 years. It is pretty much a forgotten memory at this point.

(6-7 lines is standard, don't know how I can fill this up, will try to fill at least 4 lines).
