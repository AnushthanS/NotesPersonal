###  Identify and list your bad habits & mention how do you want to work on them so that you can get rid of them.

- Procrastination- While this habit is not particularly uncommon to people, I still feel that minimizing this further can benefit me more than any other destructive habits mentioned here.
What I'm actively trying to do is repeat to myself frequently that the pending work won't finish itself, as well as manage a to-do list.

- Waking up late- A particularly annoying habit, especially when it ruins the plan of the day. 

To counter this, I keep my phone at a distance so that I have to get out of bed to shut the alarm off. This also brings a sense of urgency to not disturb anyone else in the household.

- Being too carefree- While this may seem to be a good habit at times, it most certainly isn't, especially when some deadline or an important event is approaching and you can't work faster to meet that requirement. A little bit of pressure is always healthy.

To counter this, I try to keep looking at my to-do list again and again and repeating to myself that I need to be faster in the face of some approaching deadline.

- Being forgetful of my health- Be it the sacrifice of sleep to finish a task, or to study for a test, or to ignore daily jogs to watch just a bit more of some tv series, this can be argued as the most destructive habit one can have for the long run.  
  
To sleep at a proper time, I make use of a sleep tracking app with reminders. Physical activity tracking apps help with a daily goal of fitness.

 
###  When peers put pressure on you which is negative, mention 5 ways on how would you avoid ( other than those mentioned in reading material)
1. Find an opportunity to change the topic. 
2. Make an excuse to leave. 
3. Find an excuse to stall the activity for some other event. 
4. Rope in the conversation someone who can be swayed a bit easier to your side while being diplomatic.
5. If the topic is freshly raised, suggest a different activity.
